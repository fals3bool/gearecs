 * @brief High-level ECS world management for gearecs library
 *
 * This header provides convenience functions for creating and managing
 * a complete ECS world with pre-configured systems and components.
 * It offers a simplified interface for common game development workflows
 * by handling the setup of the ECS registry, camera, and main game loop.
 *
 * The world management functions include:
 * - Pre-configured ECS registry creation with camera integration
 * - Automatic system registration for built-in functionality
 * - Main game loop handling with proper phase ordering
 * - Integration with raylib's window and rendering system

 * Creates a pre-configured ECS world with camera support.

 * and sets up the necessary infrastructure for a typical game application.
 *
 * The world includes support for:
 * - Built-in components (Transform2, RigidBody, Collider, Behaviour, etc.)
 * - Built-in systems (physics, rendering, collision, etc.)
 * - Camera integration for 2D rendering
 *
 * @return Pointer to created ECS world, or NULL on failure.
 *
 * @see EcsLoop() for running the main game loop
 * @see EcsFree() for freeing the world when done
 * @see WorldMainCamera() to retrieve the main camera
 * @see EcsRegistry() for creating a basic empty registry
